# Watch Where You Stab
Client-side mod that lets aim melee attacks up or down up to a maximum angle (configurable). 
The configured maximum angle is only applied to attacks that would not normally allow you to attack at that angle. 
This mod will never reduce the maximum angle of existing attacks.

## Why Use This?
Because you can configure the maximum allowed angle for melee attacks rather than just uncapping it entirely, you can tune the mod to your preferences.

Due to the in-game camera being positioned above the player character, the camera is often looking downwards and if you fully uncap the allowed angle for 
melee attacks it is very possible to miss attacks because they went too low, which is also frustrating. By setting the maximum angle for melee attacks to
45 degrees you can look straight down but you'll still attack at a 45 degree angle forwards and down rather than attacking straight down.

You can also keep the cap very small, say in the range of 5-20 degrees to make it so each weapon still has a different feel and they can't 
all hit high up or down low while still reducing the frustration caused by being on a slight incline.

If you set the config to 90 degrees though, then `WatchWhereYouStab` is effectively the same as `VerticallyChallenged` or `SlopeCombatFix`.

## Instructions
If you are using a mod manager for Thunderstore simply install the mod from there. 
If you are not using a mod manager then, you need a modded instance of Valheim with BepInEx 
installed and to put the dll file for this mod into the plugins folder of BepInEx.

## Configuration
Changes made to the configuration settings will be reflected in-game immediately (no restart required). 
The mod also has a built in file watcher so you can edit settings via an in-game configuration manager 
(changes applied upon closing the in-game configuration manager) or by changing values in the file via a text editor or mod manager.

## Known Issues
None so far, tell me if you find any.
