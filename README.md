# Watch Where You Stab
Client-side mod that lets aim melee attacks up or down up to a maximum angle (configurable).

## Instructions
If you are using a mod manager for Thunderstore simply install the mod from there. If you are not using a mod manager then, you need a modded instance of Valheim with BepInEx installed and to put the dll file for this mod into the plugins folder of BepInEx.

## Configuration
Changes made to the configuration settings will be reflected in-game immediately (no restart required). The mod also has a built in file watcher so you can edit settings via an in-game configuration manager (changes applied upon closing the in-game configuration manager) or by changing values in the file via a text editor or mod manager.

## Known Issues
None so far, tell me if you find any.

## Donations/Tips
My mods will always be free to use but if you feel like saying thanks you can tip/donate.

If you would like to provide suggestions, make feature requests, or reports bugs and compatibility issues you can either open an issue on the Github repository or tag me (@searica) with a message on my discord [Searica's Mods](https://discord.gg/sFmGTBYN6n).

I'm a grad student and have a lot of personal responsibilities on top of that so I can't promise I will respond quickly, but I do intend to maintain and improve the mod in my free time.
